# Git LFS on Glitch

---

**Made with ❤️ by [@youngchief-btw](https://github.com/youngchief-btw)**

---

Bring **Git LFS** support to **Glitch**

**Git LFS Version:** v2.10.0

---

**NOTE:** Do not remix from Glitch project, just do it from Github (because I could be working on updating live and so many other reasons). If this fails for some reason feel free to contact me over Discord (In my profile)

---

**Steps to use:**

Go to a Glitch project (preferably a new project, because the below command deletes .git and then make a new git repo), then open up the terminal, and run the following

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/youngchief-btw/GitLFS-On-Glitch; rm -rf .git; git init;
```

**You are done!!!**
